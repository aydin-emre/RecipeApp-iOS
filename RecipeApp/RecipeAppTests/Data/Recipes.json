        "story": "“I was inspired to make this soup by the #CookEveryPart challenge and reducing food waste. I had vegetables that were still edible but past their best to eat raw or steamed. Roasting root vegetables slowly deepens the flavour ( and is a no fuss way to make soup). I could not quite use every part - there were some woody tops - but these went into my compost bin for the veg garden,” says Bellhorse, a Cookpad community member in the UK.\n\nTestimonial from Sonia, our community manager in the UK: \n\n“Root vegetables are easily sourced during all seasons in the UK and particularly in winter. Vegetables like this often go into the food waste when people leave them too long in their fridge or vegetable rack, but they are often easily saved and in fact the flavour improved by cooking them slowly and with love in the oven. Very woody tops and stalks are best left out of the soup, but you can leave the vegetables whole and unpeeled, simply give them a good wash and scrub to remove any dirt. If you tried this recipe, let our friend Bellhorse know by submitting your Cooksnap to her original recipe. It will make her happy! \n\nhttps://cookpad.com/uk/recipes/13775204-oven-roasted-root-vegetable-soup",

Most grandmas are home doctors with lots of natural medical recipes. This has recently attracted the new generation's attention as well, so you’ll find a lot of young people drinking hot tea made of different herbs instead of taking caffeine. Even if they are not sick they prefer natural healthy drinks especially in winter. A good example is this tea made of corn cobs which can be served hot or cold.

As a result, we can’t have throughout the whole year. That’s why when there are plenty of lemons, we store them. In this way, we are going to keep the smell and freshness of lemons for our recipes. In the same way, we can also store oranges. I haven’t tried it with clementines, but I guess it will work as well.” -- Chrysoula, a Cookpad community member from Rhodes, Greece.\n\n#CookEveryPart\n\nTestimonial from Nafsika, our community manager in Greece: \n\n“Greece is full of lemon trees and lemons are widely used in our traditional daily food and desserts. They are used to create a sour, light taste in our meals and they are perfect for poultry, meat and definitely fried (or other) fish! If we have a sweet tooth, we use them widely to give a fresh, aromatic taste in our syrupy desserts, such as baklava and galaktompoureko, and, of course in our cakes.

        "story": "“Make a snack and a syrup altogether 😍 To #CookEveryPart, this time I made orange peel gummy and syrup from the same set of ingredients. Yummy… This is like any other candied orange peels. The difference is that my recipe assures a smooth taste and no bitterness at all. Perfect for snacking while you are reading a book or watching a Korean drama... this is so great 😍😁” -- Phie, a Cookpad community member from Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nTestimonial from Aprina, our community manager in Indonesia: \n\n“Another unique way to consume your orange entirely. This recipe does not shake off the freshness of the orange itself so you can still get the orange as fruit and process the orange peel becoming a new cooking creation. Natural yet sweet and safe to be consumed for children -- at a normal level, of course 😉. If you tried this recipe, let our friend Phie know by submitting your Cooksnap to her original recipe. It will make her happy!\n\nYou can find her original recipe here: https://cookpad.com/id/resep/13692285-orange-gummy-syrup",

For the third week of #cookeverypart #wastewarrior challenge we love this recipe from Nessi in the German Cookpad community made this delcious bread dumplings.\nNessi says, \"For this recipe, I always collect leftover bread, pretzels and rolls in a bowl until there are enough for a new round of dumplings. Just cut the leftover bread into cubes, let them dry well and then collect them. The bread dumplings are great for freezing. Just let them cool down after cooking and wrap them up well and put them in the freezer. If you want to use the frozen bread dumplings, defrost them and then cook them only until they are warm, i.e. as briefly as possible, so that they do not soak up the cooking water.\n\nDo you have a recipe that uses bread?
